Steps to deploy to App Service

1. Using an FTP client of your choice, upload your JDBC driver, jboss-cli-commands.cli, startup_script.sh, to /site/deployments/tools/. FTP credentials can be found under **Deployment Center > FTPS credentials**
2. Configure your site to run startup_script.sh when the container starts. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Configuration > General Settings > Startup Command**. Set the startup command field to /home/site/deployments/tools/startup_script.sh, then select Save.
